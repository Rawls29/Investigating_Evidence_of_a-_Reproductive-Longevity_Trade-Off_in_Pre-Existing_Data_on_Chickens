# Investigating_Evidence_of_a-_Reproductive-Longevity_Trade-Off_in_Pre-Existing_Data_on_Chickens
Data and code for project entitled "Investigating Evidence of a Reproductive-Longevity Trade-Off in Domesticated Chickens (Gallus gallus)" by Samuel Rawlinson (March 2022)
The litsearchr code used to refine search terms for total lifespan and productive lifespan searches are available in "litsearchr longevity.R" and "litsearchr productivity.R", respectively
A summary of the results of searches for data both in peer-reviewed and grey literature are available in the "Systematic Literature_2.xlsx" document
The datasheet containing the data used in this project and all sources of said data is available as "Chicken_Data_3.xlsx"
All analyses conducted on this datasheet can be carried out using the code in "Annotated Code 3.Rda"
The code used to produce all graphs contained within the report are available in "Graphs 3". This requires the first section of the "Annotated Code 3.Rda" to be run to produce "chicken.Rda"
